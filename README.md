# Auth App Backend

This project is the backend component for the Auth App, providing the API endpoints for user authentication, authorization, and account management. It is built using Node.js and Express (or your preferred backend framework) and follows modern best practices for RESTful API design and security.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration endpoints.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control for API routes.
- **RESTful API:** Clean and well-documented API endpoints.
- **Security:** Implements best practices (e.g., password hashing, JWT authentication).
- **Scalability:** Designed with modularity and scalability in mind.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher recommended) – [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aboudeif/auth-app-backend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd auth-app-backend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables as needed:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   DB_URI=your_database_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

2. **Start the Server:**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

## Configuration

- **Environment Variables:** Customize your application's behavior through environment variables defined in the `.env` file.
- **Database Connection:** Ensure your `DB_URI` is correctly configured to connect to your database.
- **JWT Authentication:** The `JWT_SECRET` variable is used to sign and verify JWT tokens for secure authentication.
